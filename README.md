Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

Python 3
Required Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, mlextend, plotly, prophet, network)

Usage:
- Load the bakery sales dataset (CSV format) into the specified path variable in the code.
- Run the code using a Python interpreter (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, or any Python IDE).
  
Exploratory Data Analysis:
- The code includes data exploration and preprocessing steps.
- Descriptive statistics, revenue analysis, and visualization of top products are provided.
- Hourly sales analysis and visualization of peak hours are included.

Market Basket Analysis:
- The code implements Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis.
- Association rules are generated and visualized using a network graph.
- Production recommendations based on support, confidence, and lift are provided.
- Time Series Forecasting
- The code uses the Prophet library for time series forecasting.
- The original time series data is plotted, and the model is trained to make future predictions.
- Results are visualized, including the forecast and individual components.
